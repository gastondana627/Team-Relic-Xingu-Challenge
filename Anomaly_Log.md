# Anomaly Log: Xingu River Headwaters Expedition

| ID | Anomaly Name / Hypothesis | Approx. Location (Lat, Lon) | Combined Evidence & Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | **The Strategic Upland Plateau**<br/>*(Primary Settlement/Observation Post)* | `-15.07, -56.13` | A large, contiguous high-elevation plateau with defensible slopes overlooking the river valley. Sentinel-2 shows stable `terra firme` forest, suitable for a major settlement. |
| 2 | **The Network of Secondary Outposts**<br/>*(Defensive/Logistical Network)* | Representative Points:<br/> A: `-14.95, -55.85`<br/> B: `-14.75, -55.50` | Multiple smaller, isolated high-elevation areas suggest a network of watchtowers or support settlements forming a layered defense or logistical system. |
| 3 | **The Elevated Travel Corridor**<br/>*(Ancient Causeway/Route)* | Start: `-15.05, -55.20`<br/>End: `-14.90, -54.95` | A continuous, high-elevation ridge forming a natural causeway between two large plateaus, representing a high-probability ancient travel route. |
| 4 | **The Terrace Settlement**<br/>*(Habitation Site with Terra Preta)* | `~ -12.15, -53.40` | A cluster of low-relief mounds on a flat terrace, visible in SRTM. Sentinel-2 shows a mottled vegetation texture (light pinks/cyan) consistent with nutrient-rich *terra preta* soil from long-term human habitation. Located on the edge of the resource-rich floodplain "supermarket". |
| 5 | **The Artificial Shoreline**<br/>*(Possible Canal, Dock, or Sacred Grove)* | `~ -12.12, -53.42` | An unnaturally straight shoreline on Lagoa do Curumim, visible in SRTM. Sentinel-2 imagery shows a corresponding line of slightly different vegetation. The area is also associated with a unique, concentrated mass-flowering event of a specific tree species, suggesting this shoreline may have been a specially cultivated or sacred area. |
