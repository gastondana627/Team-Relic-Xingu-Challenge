### C2. Comparative Analysis: A Lost Neighbor to Kuhikugu?

Our discovery is not an isolated phenomenon; it is a ghost that whispers the same language as the great settlements of Kuhikugu. When we place our "Terrace Settlement" (Anomaly #4) side-by-side with the well-documented "garden city" model, the resemblance is undeniable, suggesting we have found a lost piece of the same cultural puzzle.

**1. Strategic Location:**
* Known Xinguano societies strategically managed both upland and floodplain resources (Heckenberger, 2013). Our Anomaly #4 mirrors this perfectly. It is located on a stable, non-flooded terrace ("housing") with immediate access to the resource-rich floodplain ("supermarket").

**2. Settlement Form:**
* The Kuhikugu complex is known for its dense clusters of residential mounds indicating long-term habitation. Our algorithmic detection successfully identified a similar dense cluster of low-relief mounds at our site.

**3. Evidence of Landscape Engineering:**
* The creation of Anthropogenic Dark Earths (*terra preta*) from the accumulation of domestic refuse is a hallmark of major residential sites in the Amazon (McMichael et al., 2012). Our AI-assisted analysis confirms our site's vegetation signature is consistent with the presence of this man-made, fertile soil.
