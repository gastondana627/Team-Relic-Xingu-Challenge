      source: "Project Paper: Anomaly 1 - Strategic Upland Plateau",
      content: "Function: This large, high-elevation plateau (-15.07, -56.13) likely served as a primary political, economic, and ritual centerâ€”a 'capital' for a major regional polity. Its strategic elevation suggests defensive advantages. Age: Hypothesized to be from the Late Holocene, roughly AD 1000-1600. Reference: Heckenberger (Amazonia 1492)."

      source: "Project Paper: Anomaly 2 - Network of Secondary Outposts",
      content: "Function: These smaller plaza villages and hamlets (e.g., -14.95, -55.85) represent an integrated regional settlement system, serving as strategic outposts, production centers, and communication hubs. Age: Co-temporal with core settlements, AD 1000-1600. Reference: Heckenberger (The Ecology of Power)."

      source: "Project Paper: Anomaly 3 - The Elevated Travel Corridor",
      content: "Function: A vast network of engineered roads and causeways designed for efficient transportation of people and goods across diverse terrains, including seasonally flooded wetlands. This facilitated trade and social cohesion. Age: Primarily developed during peak settlement from AD 1000-1600. Reference: Rostain et al."

      source: "Project Paper: Anomaly 4 - The Terrace Settlement",
      content: "Function: This site (~ -12.15, -53.40) shows evidence of highly intensive and sustainable agriculture. The terraces, combined with Amazonian Dark Earth (terra preta), indicate a sophisticated 'forest cycling' agricultural technology. Age: Intensified during the Late Holocene (AD 1000-1600). Reference: Goldberg et al."

      source: "Project Paper: Anomaly 5 - The Artificial Shoreline",
      content: "Function: Engineered modifications to lake shores (~ -12.12, -53.42) suggesting advanced water management and sophisticated aquaculture systems like fish farms or turtle pens. The use of specific tree species for stabilization highlights a holistic approach to environmental design. Reference: Loughlin et al."
