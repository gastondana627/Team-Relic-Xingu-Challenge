      source: "Team Relic Project Abstract",
      content: "Team Relic's mission is to uncover new, undocumented evidence of ancient landscapes in the Amazon's Xingu River headwaters. Our methodology fused two independent public datasets (SRTM and Sentinel-2) and used a novel 'dual wield' approach combining Gemini's visual analysis with targeted GPT-4o API prompts for deep-dive archaeological interpretation and strategic guidance."

    {
      source: "Team Relic: Historical Context",
      content: "For over a century, explorers like Percy Fawcett have searched the Amazon for 'Z', a lost city of unimaginable scale. This project challenges the myth of a pristine, untouched wilderness by using modern technology to reveal evidence of monumental human achievement in Mato Grosso, Brazil, a unique 'halfway house' ecology between dense forest and savanna."

      source: "Project Paper: Anomaly 1 - The Strategic Upland Plateau",
      content: "Function & Location: Located at (-15.07, -56.13), this large, high-elevation plateau likely served as a primary political, economic, and ritual centerâ€”a 'capital' for a major regional polity. Its strategic elevation suggests defensive advantages. Age: Hypothesized to be from the Late Holocene, roughly AD 1000-1600. Reference: [1] Heckenberger (Amazonia 1492)."

      source: "Project Paper: Anomaly 2 - The Network of Secondary Outposts",
      content: "Function & Location: Located at representative points like (-14.95, -55.85), these smaller plaza villages represent an integrated regional settlement system, serving as strategic outposts and communication hubs. Age: Co-temporal with core settlements, AD 1000-1600. Reference: [2] Heckenberger (The Ecology of Power)."

      source: "Project Paper: Anomaly 3 - The Elevated Travel Corridor",
      content: "Function & Location: This feature, running from approx. (-15.05, -55.20) to (-14.90, -54.95), is a vast network of engineered roads and causeways designed for efficient transportation and communication across diverse terrains. Age: Primarily developed during peak settlement from AD 1000-1600. Reference: [3] Rostain et al."

      source: "Project Paper: Anomaly 4 - The Terrace Settlement",
      content: "Function & Location: Located at (~ -12.15, -53.40), this site shows evidence of highly intensive agriculture. The terraces and presence of Amazonian Dark Earth (terra preta) indicate a sophisticated 'forest cycling' agricultural technology. Age: Intensified during the Late Holocene (AD 1000-1600). Reference: [5] Goldberg et al."

      source: "Competition Rules: Evaluation Criteria",
      content: "Submissions are graded on five key criteria, each worth 20 points: Evidence Depth (quality and range of data), Clarity (how convincingly the evidence converges), Reproducibility (ease for others to rerun the work), Novelty (surfacing something genuinely new or clever), and Presentation Craft (smooth visuals and overall polish)."
